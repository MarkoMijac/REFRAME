## About The Project

REFRAME is a software framework which can be used by application developers to manage reactive dependencies in object-oriented (OO) applications. In object-oriented (OO) applications, objects collaborate by invoking each other's behaviour and data, thus forming dependencies. Sometimes there is a need (or benefit) to express these dependencies as reactive, i.e. in a way that when one object changes its data or invokes a metode, its dependent objects automatically react and update their state or invoke their own methods. In practice, such dependencies are often found in event-driven systems, graphical user interfaces, animation, spreadsheet systems, embedded systems, etc. 

When need arises to treat dependencies as reactive dependences in OO applications, developers usually end up developing their own ad-hoc solutions inspired by Observer (or similar) design pattern. Such solutions may be challenging to develop form scratch. However, more importantly, such solutions often do not live up to the challenge of handling large and complex dependency graphs that may form when combining sufficient number of reactive dependencies. Some of the issues that frequently arise: not performing updates that are necessary, performing updates that are not necessary, performing updates redundantly, causing glitches (temporary inconsistencies) due to incorrect update order, creating infinite loops due to circular dependences. These issues may heavily distort results we get from the underlying software, as well as its performance. In order to avoid creating their own solutions from scratch, developers can use REFRAME to: specify individual reactive dependencies, combine reactive dependencies into a dependency graph, perform update process (sequentially or in parallel), analyse constructed dependency graph, visualize constructed dependency graph.
