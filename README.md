## About The Project

REFRAME is a software framework which can be used by application developers to manage reactive dependencies in object-oriented (OO) applications. In object-oriented (OO) applications, objects collaborate by invoking each other's behaviour and data, thus forming dependencies. Sometimes there is a need (or benefit) to express these dependencies as reactive, i.e. in a way that when one object changes its data or invokes a metode, its dependent objects automatically react and update their state or invoke their own methods. In practice, such dependencies are often found in event-driven systems, graphical user interfaces, animation, spreadsheet systems, embedded systems, etc. 

When need arises to treat dependencies as reactive dependences in OO applications, developers usually end up developing their own ad-hoc solutions inspired by Observer (or similar) design pattern. Such solutions may be challenging to develop form scratch. However, more importantly, such solutions often do not live up to the challenge of handling large and complex dependency graphs that may form when combining sufficient number of reactive dependencies. Some of the issues that frequently arise: not performing updates that are necessary, performing updates that are not necessary, performing updates redundantly, causing glitches (temporary inconsistencies) due to incorrect update order, creating infinite loops due to circular dependences. These issues may heavily distort results we get from the underlying software, as well as its performance. In order to avoid creating their own solutions from scratch, developers can use REFRAME to: specify individual reactive dependencies, combine reactive dependencies into a dependency graph, perform update process (sequentially or in parallel), analyse constructed dependency graph, visualize constructed dependency graph.

### Built With

* C# .NET
* Visual Studio 2019/2022 with DGML Editor installed
* .NET Framework

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

* C# .NET
* Visual Studio 2019/2022 with DGML Editor installed
* .NET Framework

### Installation

In order to use Reframe framework you need to obtain framework binary files (.dll and .exe files). This can be done either by downloading ready to use binaries from [GitHub Release](https://github.com/MarkoMijac/REFRAME/releases/tag/v1.0.0) page (ReframeCore.zip and ReframeTools.zip files), or by cloning the project and building these files by yourself.

### Use scenarios

Reframe framework consists of 12 .dll files and one .exe file. However, which of these files will be necessary to use depends on the use scenario. 

| Component  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ReframeCore  | The core component of the framework which enables end-user application to construct dependency graphs and perform update process. It contains abstractions representing members of reactive node hierarchy, dependency graph, update, scheduler, reactor and other essential parts of the framework.  |
| ReframeBaseExceptions  | Contains the definition of the root REFRAME exception which is inherited by specific exceptions in other components.  |
| ReframeFluentAPI | Contains classes with extension methods which allow us to use reactor in a declarative style. |
| IPCServer | Contains interfaces and abstract classes with reusable part of the server side of inter-process communication. |
| ReframeServer | Contains concrete classes with REFRAME-specific implementation of the server side of inter-process communication. |
| ReframeExporter |  Contains classes responsible for exporting dependency graph data and update process data in a form of XML content. |
| ReframeToolsGUI | Contains graphical user interface classes and coordinates the rest of the components. |
| IPCClient | Contains interfaces and abstract classes with reusable part of the client side of inter-process communication. |
| ReframeClient | Contains concrete classes with REFRAME-specific implementation of the client side of inter-process communication. |
| ReframeAnalyzer | Contains abstractions representing members of analysis graph and analysis node hierarchies, factories for creating graph and node objects, filter specifications, analysis and metrics implementations, and other parts related to graph and update analysis. |
| ReframeImporter | Contains utility classes which interpret XML content fetched from end-user application. |
| ReframeVisualizer | Contains interfaces and abstract classes with reusable and technology-independent part of the visualizer implementation. |
| VisualizerDGML | Contains concrete classes implementing visualizer using DGML technology. |

From the perspective of end-user (host) application, there are three main scenarios.

1. Scenario - Core features

The first, and the most basic use scenario assumes using only two components from REFRAME, namely: ReframeCore.dll and
ReframeBaseExceptions.dll. These are mandatory components which allow end-user application to access core features of REFRAME, i.e. to construct dependency graphs and perform update process.

2. Scenario - Core features + Fluent API

The second use scenario introduces optional ReframeFluentAPI.dll component, which (as its name imply) contains implementation of Fluent interface. This allows us to, in addition to traditional imperative style, also use alternative, more declarative approach when specifying individual reactive dependencies between nodes.

3. Scenario - Core features + Fluent API + Reframe Tools

The third use scenario is only relevant if we want to use REFRAME tools. It allows us to setup inter-process communication between end-user application and REFRAME tools. By introducing IPCServer.dll, ReframeServer.dll and ReframeExporter.dll components, we can start the server in end-user application which will respond to requests from the Analyzer tool (client) and send dependency graph data. Since integration of server components into end-user application and starting the server is a trivial task, application developers can switch to and from this use scenario easily.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Example 1 - Creating and registering new reactor object
Creating new reactor object with identifier "default" and registering it in ReactorRegistry to be available for further use.

```
var reactor = ReactorRegistry.Instance.CreateReactor("default");

```

### Example 2 - Geting existing "default" reactor object from registry

```
var reactor = ReactorRegistry.Instance.GetReactor("default");

```

### Example 3 - Specifying reactive dependencies
